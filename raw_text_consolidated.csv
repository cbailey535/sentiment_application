We have service, but the cable is still down on the ground causing us to drive over it to get in and out of driveway. First- try to contact Wave and speak with a person, menu, menu, menu. When you finally guess who might help you, you wait for 49 minutes to speak with some one from Texas. Long story short- the best I could do is have a technician come out on the 20th. When they wanted us as customers, the service was commendable, but now, their response is horrible. Rated on 1 to 10, being one the lowest, I would have to say ""2"" and that's shaky. It appears to me Wave has abandoned our area here in Oregon. Shame on YOU. At a time (since the massive fires) we need the services our contract says it will provide.

622,2021-02-08T20:39:53.000,"Hello WAVE.
I am requesting two new billing categories. One for residential, and one for very small business; 100MB or less for both, at an affordable rate for those that rely on the internet for personal , and business. 
As the founder/CEO of my nonprofit; www.fymhs.org , I find your business rates too high today. I am a person on disability making good use of the time I have to use, and pay it forward. No salary ever for the nonprofit work, and little to just pay the mortgage and no frills.
I have been a residential customer for 4 years, and this month, with average usage of data under 100MG always, I am shocked to have a rate of $50.60 per month, and not the under $30. that I had before this month. It should be no more than $25. including tax for those  two categories, and possibly less for low income persons that meet the federal guidelines. I do, but you have no help.  I will reach a point where I can no longer, in good stewardship, pay for internet, and that will be a struggle finding access to check email, and attend seminars to increase my knowledge to help others.
The purpose of what I do is to provide evidence based nutrition for families to avoid type 2 diabetes. I am currently working on a federal health care submission to the USPFTF so we can step closer to wellness care.
I cannot ask for any federal or state assistance since I believe those dollars must go to those organizations that feed and house people in need at this difficult time.
The internet is an important tool for those working to accomplish great changes for ALL people, including you.
What are you willing to do in these circumstances? Remember, more people will remember those big corporations that found some heart and changed policies during hard times with favor than those that stayed with policies that border greed.
I await a response from your corporate officers, #haroldazeitz , #timklinefelter, #patrickknorr, #jtaylorcrandall, #jonathanefriesel, #scottabaker .

There has been a delightful highlight though... I talked to a very professional, compassionate and go getter rep on the phone a few days ago. Her name is Leslie Y.  She is on the East Coast, if she was local on the West Coast, I would be sure to meet her inperson to personally thank her.  I would hire her in a heartbeat. She has been really the only contact I have had with WAVE that really conveyed that she cared and was throughly checking all possibilities why we were having such a bad internet service and it was weird that only that service goes down.  Very odd when we keep being told it's an outage.  

Her TV and phone has had no issues but her internet is like a kid playing with a light switch.  We've had a few techs come out, swapped all new equipment, tested the signal and same result! We do have a tech coming this Monday...hopefully this is a senior tech because the issue maybe more than inside moms unit.",Facebook,Wave,WA-OR-CA,WA-OR-CA,Wave WA-OR-CA

Their phone representatives are powerless to advocate for bad service. Their ""computer"" voice responses are pitiful. Our cable TV has been offline for days and no-one can provide an answer or say for sure we will reduce your high billing charge. Between your computer response system and phone representative - I don't know who to believe. Got a computer phone call yesterday that said our cable TV was restored.  It wasn't - that was a lie. So the next day I called and talked to a person who didn't know when the problem would be fixed.  Today, cable TV was partially restored - however, it is not HD that we are paying a high price for.  So, I would think WAVE would reimburse us for an entire 1/2 month or more for non-existent cable TV service, right? There is NO control by County or State regulation to help customers of cable services. This is like the old ma-bell of yesteryear that had you by the shorts - you HAVE to subscribe to get this life saving service - WE MUST HAVE LOCAL NEWS DELIVERY FOR OUR SAFETY ABOUT WEATHER AND ROADS and WAVE CANNOT DELIVER THIS BASIC LIFE SAVING SERVICE RELIABLY.

1477,2021-02-24T11:14:33.000,"Mr. Weed (CEO Wave Broadband)

I am writing this message to request your company‚Äôs assistance on addressing an ever-growing situation with your companies Internet service in the city of Hubbard.  As you know a steady consistent internet service is mandatory these days with CDL (comprehensive distance learning) and many professions now having to work from home.

Since a power outage that occurred on Tuesday Feb 2nd, 2021 the QoS delivered to Hubbard has suffered greatly, with many reporting a similar situation (constant dropping and reconnecting of service).  Since the power was brought back online after the Feb 12th, 2021 Ice Storm, and internet service from Wave was slowly restored to many residents, I am hearing even more reports of this drop/reconnect issue.  Wave delivered an acceptance QoS to Hubbard prior to Feb 2nd, 2021, at which time something has occurred to a critical piece of your infrastructure that is causing issues in many parts of Hubbard.   

As of Monday evening, these drops became so bad that I started logging (via a connection monitor) how many drops occurred in a 24-hr period.  I reset this log yesterday, after one of your Support Techs came out and ran a new cable from the power pole to my home and installed a new modem.  Since 12:06 PM yesterday my personal service has now recorded a total of 439 disconnects with only a 41% availability since 12:06 yesterday.  

At this point, with many now reporting similar issues across Hubbard, your service is impacting the ability of children to attend class online (many parents are restoring to purchasing Hotspots for internet connections via cell service) or have forgone having their children attend class.
I am writing this letter to both inform you of the plight your internet QoS is having on Hubbard, but also to implore your company to address whatever infrastructure issue is preventing our city from having a continuous internet connection.

Sincerely,

Charles Rostocil
Mayor of Hubbard Oregon",Facebook,Wave,WA-OR-CA,WA-OR-CA,Wave WA-OR-CA

The fact that we have been without service for 14 days and can't even get an estimated time is not helpful because like thousands, we are in a ""work from home"" situation and it's not possible to do without internet service.

2395,2021-03-30T00:12:34.000,"They make me want to move so I can have a different service provider.

I have had problem after problem with this company with person after person.  Promises made and not kept.  The list is too long to include everything, but here are a few recent and ongoing examples.

I wanted to add phone service for my 102-year-old grandmother, but didn't want anybody in the house because of Covid.  The sales person told me I had to go to a store (30 minutes away) to get the modem.  But when I got to the store I was told they don't have equipment in store.  All said, it took me 4 hours with customer service on the phone to arrange equipment be delivered just to get new phone service (and it did not require a technician to install).

Over a year ago, they told me they needed to ""drop a new line"" to get my service quality up to what I'm paying for.  Every time I call them to schedule that I get put on hold for 45 minutes, they make promise after promise that the ""right people"" will be notified and somebody will call me back the next day.  And I never hear from anybody.  Ever.  I know they have my phone number, because they recognize my account when I call them.  I know they have my email, because they never miss sending me a bill.  They don't even claim they've tried to reach me or schedule an appointment.  But the ""construction"" team apparently is a black hole that never reads messages or tickets.  I've called during normal hours and during off hours.  I've asked to speak to supervisors and managers and their managers.  Everybody makes a promise and not a single one of them has been kept.",Facebook,Wave,WA-OR-CA,WA-OR-CA,Wave WA-OR-CA

2397,2021-03-30T17:12:05.000,"Today in: Technical Troubleshooting Trivia 

We have two very old (2010) Mac minis. One was in use at our previous house, hooked up to our tv set, so we could watch Amazon Prime and iTunes videos.

The other, I purchased to use at a contract that, sadly (or perhaps for the best) didn't last more than a week until I ""resigned"".

So, Mini #1 was updated to a relatively recent version of Mac OS X (10.12) but Mini #2 was still running the original OS (10.6).

I decided to hook Mini #2 up. 
   - cables? check
   - boots? check
   - log in? check
   - network? 
      network???

Back in the days of 10.6, ""Wi-Fi"" was called ""Airport"". And, for whatever 11-yr-old reason, this OS doesn't want to talk to our current WPA2 Wi-Fi.

It varied between telling me my password was invalid (it wasn't; I even made the password visible to ensure it was typed correctly) and telling me to contact my admin (as I am ""my admin"", this was not helpful. There was no specific or helpful information to _give_ ""my admin"").

""OK,"" I thought, ""I can work around this.""

I carried the Mini downstairs to the shelf where the router/modem is. I plugged it directly into the Ethernet cable that's plugged into the back of the router.

Nothing.

I called Wave. I asked if there was some setting I needed to apply to make wired Ethernet work.

Nope.

I tried the other Mini,
Nope.

I plugged the Ethernet cable into an E-net-to-USB adaptor and tried one of our laptops.

Hmmmm... No network connection.

Maybe it's a bad cable??

We, (being us), have plenty of Ethernet cables. Also, we've managed to unpack enough of the boxes we moved with to be able to _find_ one of those Ethernet cables.

Cable-to-adaptor in laptop? check
Cable in Mini? Check! 

We Can Haz Internet!

Downloading Mac OS X 10.11 installer: check!
Upgrading: check
Downloading Mac OS X 10.12 installer*: check!
   * yes, it really needed to be a 2-step process
Upgrading: check!

==
One might ask why I wanted to upgrade an 11-year-old Mac mini.

a) because it still runs
b) because it has a CD/DVD drive
c) because, if I decide to rehome it, I want to know it can reach the Internet
d) because not being able to talk to the 'Net was annoying me. (An old computer has some value. An old computer with an old OS that can't get on the 'Net is a brick.)",Facebook,Wave,WA-OR-CA,WA-OR-CA,Wave WA-OR-CA

They have an F rating from the Better Business Bureau.  

They make me want to move so I can have a different service provider.

I have had problem after problem with this company with person after person. Promises made and not kept. The list is too long to include everything, but here are a few recent and ongoing examples.

I wanted to add phone service for my 102-year-old grandmother, but didn't want anybody in the house because of Covid. The sales person told me I had to go to a store (30 minutes away) to get the modem. But when I got to the store I was told they don't have equipment in store. All said, it took me 4 hours with customer service on the phone to arrange equipment be delivered just to get new phone service (and it did not require a technician to install).

Over a year ago, they told me they needed to ""drop a new line"" to get my service quality up to what I'm paying for. Every time I call them to schedule that I get put on hold for 45 minutes, they make promise after promise that the ""right people"" will be notified and somebody will call me back the next day. And I never hear from anybody. Ever. I know they have my phone number, because they recognize my account when I call them. I know they have my email, because they never miss sending me a bill. They don't even claim they've tried to reach me or schedule an appointment. But the ""construction"" team apparently is a black hole that never reads messages or tickets. I've called during normal hours and during off hours. I've asked to speak to supervisors and managers and their managers. I've messaged on Facebook and given bad reviews on Yelp - these are usually met with promises that are broken broken broken.
